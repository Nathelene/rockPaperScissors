# rockPaperScissors

### Abstract:
I created an app which allows the user to play a game of Rock, Paper , Scissors. When initially opening the app two game options are provided, Classic, and Difficult. The classic game will provide three fighters (rock, paper, or scissors) which the user will select, while the difficult game provides five fighters (rock, paper, scissors, alien, and iguana). The user will play these games against the computer, which randomly selects a fighter. On the left of the screen a scoreboard will be provided to keep track of the users wins, the computer's win's are recorded to the right of the screen. The user will be able to switch between the classic and difficult games while still keeping track of points from previous games, provided the change game button.

### Context:
I created this app as my final project during mod 1 of the Turing Front End Engineering program. This project took me approximately five days to complete and allowed me the oppourtinuty to utilize the skills I had learned over the course of mod 1. 

### Languages Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Learning Goals:
- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
  - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
  - Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Wins + Challenges:
Wins: 
1. I became more comfortable with git workflow as well as the utilization of branches and merging.
2. I was able to refer the skills I had learned over the past 5 weeks and apply it to my work in a new way.


Challenges: 
1. Refactoring code to become less repetetive.
2. Translating the logic and functionality of the game into code.
